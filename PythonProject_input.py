	My contributor(s) helped me:	
	[x] understand the assignment expectations without
		telling me how they will approach it.
	[x] understand different ways to think about a solution
		without helping me plan my solution.
	[x] think through the meaning of a specific error or
		bug present in my code without looking at my code.
	Note that if you helped somebody else with their code, you
	have to list that person as a contributor here as well.
